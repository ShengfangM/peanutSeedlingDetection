# Peanut Seedling Detection Project

This repository is dedicated to the Peanut Seedling Detection project, which explores the efficacy of RGB and multi-spectral images in detecting peanut seedlings using various object detection models, including one-shot (SSD), two-shot (Faster RCNN), and transfer-based approaches (DETR).
